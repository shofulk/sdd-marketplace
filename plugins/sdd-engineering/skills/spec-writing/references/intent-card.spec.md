# Spec: PR intent card
Spec ID: SPEC-00-intent-card
Status: draft
Supersedes: none

<!-- Reference example for the spec-writing skill. It shows the format and the level of
detail. It is not a real spec of any project: SPEC-00 is never used by a real spec.
Its packages are `web` (the browser app) and `api` (the server). -->

## Problem and user

A reviewer opens a pull request and does not know what the author wanted to change.
The PR body is often short or empty. Findings outside that goal add noise.

The user is a developer who reviews PRs in the app. They need to see the intent of
the PR before they read findings, and they need to know how much they can trust it.

## Goals / Non-goals

Goals:
- Show the derived intent of a PR on the Overview tab, before the Description.
- Show what is in scope and out of scope, and how sure the system is.
- Let the user derive the intent again when the PR changed.

Non-goals:
- A "Risk areas" section. No producer of that data exists.
- The intent card on the Findings tab.
- Locales other than `en`.

## User stories

- **US-1** As a reviewer, I want to see the PR intent first on the Overview tab, so that I
  understand the goal before I read findings. → AC-1, AC-2
- **US-2** As a reviewer, I want to know when the intent is old or unsure, so that I do not
  trust it too much. → AC-3, AC-4, AC-5
- **US-3** As a reviewer, I want to derive the intent again, so that it matches the latest
  commit. → AC-6, AC-7

## Acceptance criteria (EARS)

- **AC-1** [web] WHEN the user opens the Overview tab of a PR, the Overview tab shall show
  the intent card above the Description. *Verify: e2e*
- **AC-2** [web] WHILE an intent exists for the PR, the intent card shall show the summary,
  the IN SCOPE list, the OUT OF SCOPE list, the confidence and the list of sources.
  *Verify: unit*
- **AC-3** [api] The API shall mark an intent as stale when its head SHA differs from the
  current head SHA of the PR. *Verify: it*
- **AC-4** [web] WHILE the intent is stale, the intent card shall show the badge "Stale —
  PR updated since derivation" and show "Re-derive intent" as the primary action.
  *Verify: unit*
- **AC-5** [web] WHILE the confidence of the intent is `low`, the intent card shall show
  the chip "Low confidence". *Verify: unit*
- **AC-6** [api] WHEN the API receives a derive request for a PR, the API shall derive the
  intent at the current head SHA and replace the stored intent. *Verify: it*
- **AC-7** [web] WHILE a derive request is running, the intent card shall disable the
  derive action, show the label "Deriving…" and keep the current content. *Verify: unit*
- **AC-8** [web] IF no intent exists for the PR, THEN the intent card shall show the text
  "No intent derived yet" and a "Derive intent" action. *Verify: unit*
- **AC-9** [web] IF the derive request fails, THEN the intent card shall show a toast with
  the API error message and keep its previous state. *Verify: unit*
- **AC-10** [api] IF a source linked from the PR cannot be fetched, THEN the API shall keep
  the source in the list with status `missing` and a reason, and shall not invent its
  content. *Verify: it*
- **AC-11** [web] IF the summary or a scope item contains HTML or Markdown, THEN the intent
  card shall render it as plain text. *Verify: unit*

## Module interactions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as web (Overview tab)
  participant A as api
  participant L as LLM adapter
  participant G as GitHub adapter
  participant D as pr_intent table
  C->>A: GET /pulls/:id/intent
  A->>D: read intent
  A-->>C: PrIntentResponse (intent or null, stale flag)
  C->>A: POST /pulls/:id/intent/derive
  A->>G: fetch linked sources
  A->>L: one structured call (no diff bodies)
  A->>D: replace intent
  A-->>C: PrIntentResponse
```

Contracts at the boundary (existing, in the shared contracts package):

| Contract | Direction | Fields used |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `GET /pulls/:id/intent` → `PrIntentResponse` | api → web | `intent` (`PrIntentRecord` or `null`) |
| `POST /pulls/:id/intent/derive` → `PrIntentResponse` | web → api → web | same |
| `PrIntentRecord` | api → web | `summary`, `in_scope`, `out_of_scope`, `confidence`, `sources[]` (`kind`, `ref`, `status`, `reason`), `stale`, `model`, `derived_at` |

Errors: `404` when the PR does not exist; `502` when the model call fails. Table read and
written: `pr_intent` (existing).

## Edge cases

- **EC-1** The PR was never analysed, so no intent exists. → AC-8
- **EC-2** The model call fails or times out during derive. → AC-9
- **EC-3** The PR body links an issue that returns 404. → AC-10
- **EC-4** The PR summary contains HTML or a Markdown link. → AC-11

## Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-1** Performance: the API shall answer `GET /pulls/:id/intent` within 300 ms at p95 on
  the seeded dataset, because it reads one row and calls no model. *Verify: it*
- **NFR-2** Cost: one derive shall make at most 1 model call plus 1 repair retry.
  *Verify: unit*
- **NFR-3** Accessibility: every action on the card shall be reachable with the keyboard,
  with 0 axe violations of level A or AA. *Verify: e2e*

## Assumptions

- **A-1** The intent route already returns `stale`. Risk if wrong: the server needs a
  contract change first.
- **A-2** Reviewers read the Overview tab before the Findings tab. Risk if wrong: the card
  is seen too late and US-1 is not met.

## Inputs and provenance

- Design: `designs/intent-card/overview.png` (example path; read).
- Code read: `web/src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/`, `api/src/modules/`,
  `contracts/src/review-api.ts`.
- Existing spec: `api/.spec/intent-layer.spec.md`.
- Round 1, Q: "Show a Risk areas section?" → No (Non-goal).
- Round 1, Q: "What does the card show while derive runs?" → Keep content, disable action
  (AC-7).

## Untrusted inputs

- PR title, PR body and linked issues come from outside. The server wraps them as
  untrusted text in the model prompt (`wrapUntrusted`).
- The summary and the scope lists are model output. The client renders them as plain
  text (AC-11).
- The API response is checked against `PrIntentResponse` before use.

## Open questions

- **Q-1** (non-blocking) Should the card collapse when the PR has more than 20 sources?
- **Q-2** (planner) Reuse the existing `Skeleton` for loading, or a card-specific one?
