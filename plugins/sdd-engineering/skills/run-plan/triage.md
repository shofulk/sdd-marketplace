# /sdd-engineering:run-plan — triage of a review round

Turns the reports of a round into one fix list. The main session does this itself, in writing
(`NN-fix-list.md` in the run folder), before any fix is dispatched.

## 1. Collect

One row per item: every architecture finding, every security finding (when the project has a
security reviewer; its *needs verification* list is item 4 below), every plan-verifier row that
is `not met`, `partial` or `cannot verify`, every *Unplanned changes* line and every
`bypass-candidate`. Plan-verifier rows marked `awaiting manual` are not fix items: they are
collected once into the user's list, get no F ID, and are not re-raised in later rounds.

## 2. Decide, per item

| Item | Goes to | Fixed this run? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| architecture `critical` / `major` | `sdd-engineering:implementer` fix | yes |
| architecture `minor` | — | no: listed under *Open minors* in `summary.md`; fixed only if the user asks |
| security finding | implementer fix | yes |
| plan item `not met` / `partial` — code missing or wrong | implementer fix | yes |
| plan item `partial` — only the test is missing or weaker than the Test-plan row | the project's `test-writer` (after), else implementer fix | yes |
| plan item `cannot verify` — needs a stack, a probe, a service | Phase 3 manual acceptance, then plan-verifier re-run | yes, as evidence |
| plan item `awaiting manual` — only the user or an absent browser can run it | the user: listed in `summary.md` under what is not verified, with what to run and the expected result | no: not a fix item, does not keep the round from being clean, and is not re-raised |
| *Unplanned changes* line | revert in implementer fix, or the user accepts it | ask when it is not clearly noise |
| red test edited (hash mismatch) | implementer fix: restore the file, fix the code | yes |
| item says the **plan** is wrong (the AC, a step, a Verify) | stop → `implementation-planner` Update mode, input: the report path | no |
| `bypass-candidate` | reproduce through the full hook JSON (pipe a PreToolUse payload into the guard and read the exit code); reproduced → a security item | yes |

## 3. Check before you dispatch

- **Ground it.** A finding whose `file:line` is not in the change set, or whose evidence does not
  match the file, is rejected — record it under *Rejected* with what you saw.
- **Dedupe** on `(file, line, category)` across the reports; keep the highest severity, merge the
  evidence.
- **Disagree with evidence, not opinion.** If the finding contradicts the plan, a skill or a
  project rule from the context files, quote the rule and reject it under *Rejected*; the next
  re-review gets the quote. If you cannot settle it, ask the user.
- **Conflicts.** Two items that need opposite changes are one question for the user.

## 4. Security *needs verification*

Do not fix on suspicion. Read the cited source → sink; confirmed → a security item, otherwise
*Rejected* with the reason.

## 5. Fix list format

```markdown
# Fix list · round <r>

| ID | Source | Severity | file:line | Finding | Goes to | Expected after the fix |
|----|--------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|------------------------|
| F1 | architecture-reviewer #2 | major | `api/src/modules/x/service.ts:41` | … | implementer (api) | … |

## Rejected
- <source #n> — <why, with the quoted rule or the line you read>

## Open minors (not fixed unless the user asks)
- <source #n> — <finding>
```

IDs `F<n>` never repeat across rounds — a finding that survives a round keeps its ID, so the
retro and the budget question see it recur.
